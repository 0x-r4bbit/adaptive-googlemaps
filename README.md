# Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Please make a pull request against canary branch and do not bump versions. Also include tests.

# Testing

More tests will be added...

We use karma and jshint to ensure the quality of the code. The easiest way to run these checks is to use grunt:

    npm install -g grunt-cli
    npm install
    bower install
    grunt

The karma task will try to open Chrome as a browser in which to run the tests. Make sure this is available or change the configuration in `test/test.config.js`
